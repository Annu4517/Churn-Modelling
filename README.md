**Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s services. The objective of this project is to analyze customer data and build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn.

**Objectives**

To understand factors influencing customer churn
To preprocess and prepare customer data for modeling
To train a machine learning model for churn prediction
To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

**Technologies Used**

Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

**Methodology**

Data loading and exploration
Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
Feature selection and preprocessing
Model training using machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation using accuracy and other performance metrics

**Results**

The machine learning model was able to predict customer churn with reasonable accuracy. The results demonstrate how customer attributes such as account details and service usage patterns influence churn behavior.

**Future Improvements**

Experiment with advanced machine learning and neural network models
Deploy the model as a web application
